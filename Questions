1. In which user group are you on Soroban? 

Eine Datei erstellen
ls -alh

groups


2. Next to root, how many different user groups exist on Soroban?

ls /scratch/ |sort – u / wc -l


3. s the number of user groups in /home and in /scratch identical?

ls /scratch/ |sort – u / wc -l - 444
ls /home/ |sort – u / wc -l    - 445

4. Set up an alias that all file removal must first be prompted.

alias rm=”rm -i”

5. What command (including the correct option) would I use to remove all linebreaks from a variable (VAR1) that contains a multi-line string? 

echo "|$COMMAND|"|tr '\n' ' '

-tr 


6. What filetype is the command file?

file filename

which file    →       /usr/bin/file
echo -e $(echo “hello\nworld”)
file $(which file)
????????????????????????????????

process id abgeben, wie viel RAM, CPU
echo $! 

standard input, ouput, error
 versteckte Dateien beginnen mit einem Punkt

6. Echo the string ” Hello World!“ so that the two words printed on different lines; save this multi-line string to variable VAR1. 
VAR1=’Hello\World!’
echo -e “SVAR1”
7. Echo variable VAR1 and remove the line breaks through piping it to another command.
echo -e “$VAR1” | tr ‘\n’  ’ ’


8. How can you append a line to the last line of a file (i.e., without appending it as a new line)?

VAR1=”${VAR1}\n”

9. Can you append to a file that does not even exist yet? Thus: What is safer: Passing output by default or appending output by default? 

Ja:
echo -e “\n” >> notexisting
cat notexisting

10. Can you pass output to a variable? If so, how? I
output=$(expression)
z.B. output=$(date)

11. Set your bash such that the history is saved to a file with the date in the filename upon logout.

history > history_for_print.txt

12. Please find the latest module for the software ’MrBayes’ I

module avail mrbayes
mrbayes/3.2.5

13. What is the difference between adding and loading a module? 


14. Which of the two commands (module load and module add) is more helpful, especially if you don’t remember whether a module has already been loaded? I


15. Look through and try to understand the example SLURM submission script I am providing on Blackboard. Do you have any suggestions for improvement? I

- mkdir -p $INDIR 
(input directory generieren, wenn es nicht existiert, wenn sie ex, mach weiter)
ansonsten ensteht es, als alles schon läuft

- bayes kann schon früher geladen werden vor INDIR=/scratch/username/2017.05.12/

- überprüfen, ob mb-parallel überhaupt existiert

- mkdir -p output/
cleans scratch and transfers all data to home


16. Check the number of CPUs used when executing jModeltest on its test data on /home (see next lecture).

17. How many MB of memory did the execution of jModeltest need?

18. How many MB of memory did the execution of sms need?

19. Did the measruing of memory usage work?

20. Is there something strange?

21. What was the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model for each dataset / modeltesting software? 

22. Which of the three modeltesting software tools requires the least amount of memory?

23. Why is that comparison flawed?

Exercise I
Test a MrBayes analysis on /home I

Identify the module of the most recent version of MrBayes and load its module. I

Test if the input file (a NEXUS file) can be executed with MrBayes. 

Run a few MCMC generations on /home. 

If test was successful: Estimate time, memory and number of CPUs required for a full analysis involving 20.000.000 generations. 

Unload the module again.



Start a MrBayes analysis on /scratch using the queueing system 

Set up a batch file using the above estimates of time, memory and number of CPUs; use Michael’s MrBayes batch file as a template. 

In the batch file, make sure that the MrBayes module is loaded. 

Make the temporary folder on /scratch and copy the infile into it as specified in the batch file. 

Submit the batch file (sbatch batch file) and monitor the queue (squeue -u $USER).
 

Exercise II

Test PartitionFinder2 on /home 

Load the module for PartitionFinder2; it is a Python package. 

Test the software PartitionFinder2 on /home, using its own example data (examples/nucleotide/test.phy) 

If test data is not available on Soroban, get it from the software’s GitHub account (https://github.com/brettc/partitionfinder).




Test PartitionTest on /home 

Load the module for PartitionTest; it is a compiled executable. 

Test the software PartitionTest on /home, using its own example data (examples/DNA/test.phy). 

If test data is not available on Soroban, get it from the software’s GitHub account (https://github.com/ddarriba/partitiontest).



Test partitNex2MrBayes on /home I

Clone the GitHub directory of partitNex2MrBayes (https://github.com/michaelgruenstaeudl/ partitionedNex2MrBayes) to your local harddrive. 

SFTP the directory to Soroban; it may be easier to transfer a compressed tar archive of the directory. 

Use the example file testing.nex and execute partitNex2MrBayes on /home.


Set up a batch file for partitNex2MrBayes

Start an analysis with partitNex2MrBayes on /scratch
